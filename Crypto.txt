* NFT = Non-Fungible Token
* DeFi = Decentralized Finance
* SMA = Simple Moving Average
* ILO = Initial Liquidity Offering

* Crypto coin: Is an independent project which has its own block chain. I.e. bitcoin, cardano, ethereum, harmony-one, algorand and so forth.

Crypto token: Doesn't have its own block chain. It's built on another crypto block chain. In the case of Shiba Inu, it's built on the Ethereum block chain via ERC20 token. SHIB's tokenization is created via ERC20. This is why you need to pay eth gas fee to move it to the shibaswap because it's on the eth main net.
