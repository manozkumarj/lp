* While importing an SQL file, make sure that SQL file won't contain
	-> AUTO_INCREMENT
	-> UNIQUE
	-> KEY
	-> UNSIGNED

* Make sure to have INT in place of INT(10)
* AUTO_INCREMENT won't work in SQLite database, if you want you need to get the max ID from that table manually and increment it by 1 then pass it to next insertion query.
