* The <section> tag: The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
The <article> tag: The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

* What is a Web Worker?
A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.

A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.
