* --------- Few Tips and Tricks to groom yourself for the Interview ---------
Here are some tips and tricks to answer one of the famous questions, "Tell me about yourself". This is a very common question which everyone (including a highly experienced candidate) has to answer in an interview. Here, my concentration is very much on freshers and people with minimal experience. As this group of candidates usually end up giving irrelevant information. When this question is asked, make sure the following points are considered:

Get started with your current status and gradually cover your past achievements. The current status could be your work or your education. And the past achievements could be your previous projects or your lower education qualification.

Itâ€™s a good practice to keep your conversation entirely technical and not personal. Never tell your family details to the panel till asked. They are not interested in your family background. Always remember the panel is interested in you as a technical person and nothing else.

Answer the questions aptly, be to the point and do not extend the answer or elaborate too much, unless asked to. Be straightforward and say "No" if you do not know it.

Do not take too much time in answering the questions, as the panel would want to test the depth of your knowledge. So, allow them to talk and allow them to get the most out of you.

Gone are the days when you simply show yourself as a person who can deliver the given task. Show them that you are into multiple things, apart from your regular work.
