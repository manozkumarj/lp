* Lazy loading is a design pattern in Ionic framework used to defer initialization of components until it is needed. This practice speeds up the initial load of the application and increases performance.
* Cordova allows you to access native device functions using JavaScript, and is typically used in combination with a UI framework. Ionic is a front-end, mobile-optimized library that can be used to make your Cordova app look native.

* npm install ionic cordova -g
