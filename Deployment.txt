* CI(Continuous Integration) means everytime we make a commint/push to the branch, a new Build and Automation Test will be done. Integration means Pushing the code/Merging the new code into the codebase
* CD(Continuous Delivery) means pushing that build to a dev/mock server. Delivery means Making it available for deployment.
* Not every company/project follows both CI and CD. Few companies follow only CI and few may follow CD.
* There are different tools available to implement CI/CD like - Jenkins, AWS, Git-Actions



-------------------------------------------- Docker -----------------------------------------------------------
* Docker is an ecosystem where we can create containers/run containers
* Sometimes the project will work perfectly on devs machine but not on testers/other devs machine who took copy of our project, it's due to some dependencies may dependent on OS. This kind of problem will solve by Docker. We can transfer our project with same dependencies/modules.
* Containers can be created by images. When we page a container it will create an image, and that image can be transffered/shared with anyone who needs it.

* SSH stands for Secure Shell
* Secure connection between two machines
* Allows remote administration of servers
* Use it to transfer files to a remote server
* SSH or Secure Shell is a network communication protocol that enables two computers to communicate (c.f http or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to transfer hypertext such as web pages) and share data.
* What is SSH command?
ssh stands for “Secure Shell”. It is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote server/system. ... ssh command instructs the system to establish an encrypted secure connection with the host machine.
* What is the difference between SSL and SSH?
The first difference between SSL and SSH is their application. SSL is mostly used for establishing a secure connection between website and clients, while SSH is utilized to create secure remote connections on insecure networks. The second difference between SSL and SSH is in the method they both operate.
* What is the difference between https and SSH?
Any time someone uses a website with a URL that starts with HTTPS, he is on a site with SSL/TLS. SSH is for securely executing commands on a server. SSL is used for securely communicating personal information. SSH uses a username/password authentication system to establish a secure connection.
